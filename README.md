# Final Project

You’ve learned a ton about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this course. The final project is your chance to build a website of your own design from scratch.

This is a team project. Your team will have to agree on a project idea. If you have a firm idea of what you want to build, make sure to tell your partners before you decide to join the team together.

## Topic and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide what your final project will be. The challenge is to choose a design that is exciting to you, but is not so big that it’s overwhelming or impossible to complete.

Here’s some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project you’ll be able to complete.

- Your final project should be about as complicated as the most complicated exercises and projects you’ve already done, or maybe a little bit more advanced.
- Use what we've learned in the course: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Don’t use a whole new technology for the final project.

What features should you avoid?
- Collecting data
- Forms
- Payment

We haven’t covered how to collect and save data from users. Don’t plan to build a banking app, a social media website, or an e-commerce site.

## How should you work together?

You’ll should figure out what works best for your team. The best teams communicate clearly up front, so that there isn’t confusion about what is going on. Try to agree on how you’ll communicate (Discord, Whatsapp, email, or something else), and when you’ll get together to work on the project.

It may be helpful to create a design doc. Using Google docs or a text file in Repl.it, write down your ideas. You might include links, images, drawings, and text that helps to explain what you are planning to build.

A design doc can also help you track what work you’ve done, and what work is left to do.
